# React Named Reducer Change Log

## Inception of react-named-reducer :D

* Inception :D => Modifies [react-reducer-context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reducer-context)
  * Now contexts are accessed by name => more easy to use and no need for `createContext` or `useContext`.
  * Removes default exports, mainly `NamedReducer`.
